# Front-End Web OmniStack 10 - Rocketseat

This project was developed at rocketseat's OmniStack 10 week. The aim of this project is to develop a platform to search for developers near you by technology, so companies and developers can find people close by, who work with the technologies they seek through the GitHub profile.

[Back-End](https://github.com/CarlosValdiero/backend-Omnistack10-Rocketseat) - Back-end project using NodeJS and Express

[Front-End Mobile](https://github.com/CarlosValdiero/frontend-mobile-omniStack10-rocketseat) - Front-end project using React Native

The motivation to develop this project was to learn about ReactJS.

### Tech

 - ReactJS
 - Axios

### System idea

 - In this system the developer informs which technologies he works with, their location and profile on GitHub.
 - Another developer, or company, looks for developers in your region for a particular technology, and accesses their GitHub profile.
